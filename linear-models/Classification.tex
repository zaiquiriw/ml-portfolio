\hypertarget{classification}{%
\section{Classification}\label{classification}}

This time we will be using linear models in order to classify
observations. Linear models like logistic regression and Naive Bayes
work by finding the probability of a target variable given a predictor
variable. This means we are predicting a class as opposed to a
continuous value like in linear regression. These models are great for
data with outliers and are easy to implement and interpret. Linear
regression isn't very flexible however, and Naive Bayes makes a naive
assumption that predictors are independent.

\hypertarget{what-is-our-data}{%
\subsection{What is Our Data?}\label{what-is-our-data}}

The weather data we used in our quantitative didn't have a suitable
categorical target field, so we are switching to
\href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rdcmdev/adult-income-dataset}{income
census data}. The data has a great binary classification in the form of
an IncomeClass attribute that only states whether a given person's
income is below or above 50k. We have plenty of categories for each
person, and continuous measurements like age and work hours.

The census itself is from the year 1994, and spans various
socieo-economic groups. We both trying to predict this income
classification based on all of the data, as well as just get an
understanding of some key predictors in the data.

With IncomeClass as our target, lets analyze the data!

\hypertarget{reading-the-data}{%
\subsubsection{Reading the Data}\label{reading-the-data}}

The data is stored as two files, with rows just delimited by commas, so
we read them in to one whole data frame, and label the headers manual
using our source as a reference. It's worth noting that this data was
extracted with the intention of creating a classification model, so the
two files are meant to be training and test data, but we are going to
re-distribute the data later.

Now we want to turn the qualitative data into factors.

Find all attributes of income that are non-numeric - sapply() returns a
logical object of every attribute run through the given function -
which() returns all of the true indices of a logical object -
income{[},{]} extracts the attributes (See help(Extract)) - We then
lapply, with as.factor forcing them to be factors in a list

Then just factor them.

Now that we can really see our factor's options, I see a couple skewed
data points: - Twice as many men as women! Hope those numbers are better
in 2022! - A large percent of the data is for natives to the US, which
is kind of expected - Weight: Now, this represent what census takers
thought a particular row represented the whole of the dataset. I must
admit at the time I don't know how to account for statistical weight,
but considering our model only needs to match training data, not other
data from 1994, we are safe to ignore it.

The data looks very clean! Except for a bit of an anomaly with how the
Target column, IncomeClass is stored. Some levels have a ``.'' at the
end, which we would like to remove. So lets go ahead and condense that,
remove the Weight attribute, and create our training and test data.

\hypertarget{text-analysis-conclusion}{%
\paragraph{Text Analysis Conclusion}\label{text-analysis-conclusion}}

We fear the skew of my data towards 1 type of person (Married Men about
to hit their 40's) will make the model's we produce perform well for our
dataset, but fail to get any real world accuracy. Obviously if this
model was actually destined to predict in the real world if people's
income was above or below a certain level (in the 1990's), well if we
had all this data we would probably already know their income. So the
model is a pointless but fun experiment\ldots{}

Regardless it is worth noting that a transformation of the data before
running logistic regression or naive bayes could produce better results,
but it is beyond the scope of this experiment.

While it is probably a realistic distribution of income class (3 people
with less than 50k for every person over 50k), the data may just guess
that everyone doesn't make that much money due to the skew. This
actually is a lot more important then skewed predictors, as our eventual
precision/recall could be quite bad. For now, simply observing this is
good enough, but this should be onsidered for the final analysis. (And
perhaps in our comparision between Bayes and logistic regression).

Numerical trends are just easier to spot, especially the effect of age
on IncomeClass. You can definitely see in the ease graphs, particular
age and hours worked, that there are \emph{some} grounds to predict this
income classification based on the predictor data.

Above we can see a couple trends relating to Income Class: - Women don't
make as much as men - It seems the more hours worked, the higher your
chances of making it over 50k - Right around 50 years old is when people
were the most likely to make \textgreater50k

\hypertarget{visual-analysis-conclusion}{%
\paragraph{Visual Analysis
Conclusion}\label{visual-analysis-conclusion}}

There are so many different factors in this data, that we think assuming
the factors are independent could harm the eventual accuracy of our
linear models. While we can graph individual factors relation to the
target, there are complicated relationships between the predictor data.
We may be able to guess that more education would lead to a higher
income, but an in-depth analysis of how gender or native country may
hamper access to education isnt represented by just the relationship
from gender to income. To the final product, it just \emph{looks} like
you can bet women make less money, even if that may be due to a
compaction of other factors.

Just a couple trends are seen above, and they still tell us that there
is some merit to this data being alble to predict relations between our
predictors and our target. Now it is time to see if all of those
predictors together have a good chance of classifying them into the
\textgreater50k or \textless=50k levels.

Ah! Well we sure do get to get to view the impact of every level (dummy
variable) on the output model. Before analyzing the coefficients
predicted by the model, I want to examine which attributes were better
for the model as compared to others.

\hypertarget{explanation}{%
\paragraph{Explanation}\label{explanation}}

The data produced by the model is the coefficients of each predictor.
The coefficient represents the effect the value of the predictor has on
our target. If we have a positive coefficient like age, as age goes up
we can expect the probability of our target (IncomeClass) to go up. The
final model then considers each of these coefficients in it's
prediction. Different parts of the data are: - Deviance Residuals: - The
Null Deviance: - Residual Deviance: - Degrees of Freedom: - AIC: -
Fisher Scoring Iterations: - Standard Error: - Z Value: - P Value:

\hypertarget{looking-at-p-values}{%
\paragraph{Looking at P-Values}\label{looking-at-p-values}}

A coefficient estimate's p-values can tell us which features are
valuable predictors. However, because the data is mostly qualitative,
each level of each factor has a different impact on the data.

WorkClass seems like it is a good predictor \emph{overall}, but if a
given person's WorkClass is Never-worked, well the p-value is huge! Now,
obviously if you have never worked your income isn't going to be very
high, and the model estimates a high negative correlation. Yet the
P-Value is super high!

This could be due to a number of factors: - The sample size of people
who have never worked in this data is much smaller than the total
population. - Our target factor is skewed, so this predictor can't
differ too much from the null hypothesis - People who have never worked
have varying life experiences, so the final accuracy of their
coefficients isn't going to be able to fit the data

As humans we can see the this coefficient should be significant, so
perhaps this isn't the best dataset for logistic regression. The summary
of the model basically is this:

\begin{quote}
While factors that you would expect to negatively impact income class do
have large negative coefficents their p-values are very large because
the overall target is very skewed (probably) towards what they are
predicting (low income).
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{probability-warning}{%
\paragraph{Probability Warning}\label{probability-warning}}

Another issue with the data is the warning:

\begin{quote}
\texttt{Warning:\ glm.fit:\ fitted\ probabilities\ numerically\ 0\ or\ 1\ occurred}
\end{quote}

This error occurs when our model fits the data so well it is most likely
too perfect. This means there is \emph{somewhat likely} an error in our
data. We can check it by looking at a couple predictions:

Looking at just 30 fitted probabilities we see that not every single
probability is 1 or 0, but another warning:

\begin{quote}
Warning: prediction from a rank-deficent fit may be misleading
\end{quote}

This means our number of linearly independent columns does not equal the
number of parameters. Funny enough, the actual model throws out what it
believes are perfectly colinear variables, causing this warning. The
solution would then be to remove the colinear attributes, which will be
done in just a moment.

\hypertarget{initial-impressions}{%
\paragraph{Initial Impressions}\label{initial-impressions}}

Dismissing those issues, good predictors are: - Age - Work Class -
Education (Specifically higher education) - Job - Marriage Status - Sex
- Hours Worked

This model makes me wonder what would happen if we selected a sample
from this dataset that is less skewed, but I'm unsure what this would do
to the accuracy of this model in the real world.

\hypertarget{improving-the-model}{%
\paragraph{Improving the Model}\label{improving-the-model}}

We wanted to see if removing predictors would help the overall accuracy,
especially given that our predictors are somewhat dependent on each
other. A brief search revealed that the anova function can show how
adding each predictor effects the model.

statistically relevant

\hypertarget{conclusions}{%

There are issues with the data, mostly a high bias and a skewed target
variable, but our current model still could give good predictions given
a similar data set. If you took another sample of census data just after
this one it could probably predict income class a bit

Naive Bayes produces a model that first finds the prior probability
(A-priori, or the probability of having \textless=50k or \textgreater50k
with no considerations of other data) and then finds the probability of
the income given each condition independently. For example the table for
Sex states that the probability that someone is female given that you
make less than 50k is \textasciitilde40\%, while if a person makes more
than 50k the chance they are a woman is \textasciitilde15\%.

We also see the results for quantified predictors. For a continuous
predictor like age, the mean age for people \textless=50k is 36.85352
while people \textgreater50k are older at a mean of 44.32006 years old.

The model may just be finding the independent probabilities of the
target event given each predictor but using all of the probabilities at
once can provide a pretty good guess. Good enough to predict our
training data!

\hypertarget{issues-in-the-data}{%
\paragraph{Issues in the Data}\label{issues-in-the-data}}

It's worth noting once again that our predictors may not be completely
independent but our model here assumes they are. That is why we call it
naive! With such a large amount of data, probability can overcome the
shortcomings of this assumption and we could get reasonably accurate
predictions

\hypertarget{initial-conclusion}{%
\paragraph{Initial conclusion}\label{initial-conclusion}}

The initial conclusion to be drawn from our predictions is that our
accuracy for both our models is okay, and our logistic regression model
did better than our Naive Bayes. This could probably be due to Naive
Bayes often doing better with small data sets while logistic regression
works better with large datasets. On the other hand the logistic
regression model might have still been overwhelmed by the amount of
factors, and the accuracy was only \textasciitilde84\%.

The confusion matrix tells us True Positive, False Positive, True
Negative, and False Negative results from applying the model to the test
data. We can use the ratios between these numbers to evaluate useful
metrics like accuracy or sensitivity.

     >50k    498 1148
\end{verbatim}

Just for an example we are looking at the naive bayes confusion matrix.
- 6898: The number of True Positives - 1148: The number of True
Negatives - 498: The number of False Negatives - 1225: The number of
False Positives

We can use these to calculate other metrics

\hypertarget{accuracy}{%
\paragraph{Accuracy}\label{accuracy}}

\begin{verbatim}
Logistic R.: ~85%
Naive Bayes: ~82%
\end{verbatim}

The diagonals, or our true results, divided by all of our predictions is
our accuracy, or the percentage we were correct. As you can see, our
logistic regression model was accurate more of the time. Most likely
because it thrived more with the large amount of data.

\hypertarget{sensitivity-specificity}{%
\paragraph{Sensitivity \& Specificity}\label{sensitivity-specificity}}

\begin{verbatim}
Logistic R.: 0.9287 and 0.5874
Naive Bayes: 0.9327 and 0.4838
\end{verbatim}

Naive Bayes had a higher sensitivity, which is the number of true
positives out of true positives + false negatives (the number of
positives in the data). If we were trying to perhaps locate all people
with ``low'' income but didn't care about our accuracy with people above
50k, the stat shows naive bayes could be useful.

Specificity is the measure of true negatives in the negative class. We
can tell then that we were much better at identifying our people with
\textless=50k income than people with \textgreater50k income. However,
logistic regression was still better than Naive Bayes in this stat.

Well you ignore part of the data and perhaps get to ignore issues ini
your model (like ignoring a bunch of false negatives), these are great
for getting what matters out of data.

\hypertarget{kappa}{%
\paragraph{Kappa}\label{kappa}}

\begin{verbatim}
Logistic R.: 0.5519 
Naive Bayes: 0.4648 
\end{verbatim}

Woah! These aren't the best numbers, but considering this is a measure
of accuracy that corrects for prediction by chance, I'm surprised the
number is so high. The data set was skewed, it seemed a large margin of
the success of our models was due to random chance. According to a
reference on kappa scores though, these numbers are in ``moderate
agreement'' with what is expected.

Kappa is great for regarding datasets where the random chance of getting
a prediction high is right. Of course, there isn't a consensus on what
the number means on a scale, but its still generally useful.

\hypertarget{strengths-and-weaknesses}{%
\subsubsection{Strengths and
Weaknesses}\label{strengths-and-weaknesses}}

Logistic Regression basically is attempting to draw a line between
classes. It ends up being quite computationally inexpensive, easy to
understand, and does its job well if classes are easy to separate. But
because of it's simplicity as a line, it just isn't complex enough to
capture complex non-linear decision boundaries. Naive Bayes is also
simple, but with the added bonus that it works well with high dimensions
(complex data sets) \emph{if} they aren't too big. It's simple however
because it assumes variables are independent, and ends up lacking with
larger data sets.

\hypertarget{summary-of-metrics}{%
\subsubsection{Summary of Metrics}\label{summary-of-metrics}}

Accuracy being the ratio of correct predictions to incorrect
predictions, it is broadly useful. But often we are searching for
subsections of accuracy. Sensitivity is good for detecting the amount we
get one (the positive) class and ignores the other. Specificity on the
other hand is the ratio of correct negative classes. This means we can
use these metrics to see how ell our data is at guessing what matters in
the at. If we want to see general accuracy, but account for the chance
of getting the prediction randomly correct, Kappa is great for checking
that.

Now ROC\ldots{} well it graphs the true positive rate and the false
positive rate (sensitivity and specificity). Unfortunately we tried til
the deadline to get this to work for Naive Bayes but we swear we
understand what it means! The name, Receiver Operator Characteristic
curve comes from signal detection theory so it doesn't help much to
remind what it means. However, basically it graphs the trade off of a
model between sensitivity and specificity. The Area under the curve then
represents how much the model is capable of distinguishing between
classes.

The MCC is a metric that basically gives a good value if you get a good
reliable rate in all 4 values of the confusion matrix. The values are
considered in proportional the size of the positive and negative values.
Rather then combining the sensitivity and specificity of a metric into a
single metric (like with an F1-Score), MCC considers the size of of
negative samples. MCC's account for class distribution makes it great at
providing an accuracy rating for the whole model rated from -1 to 1.

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

We have 1 large takeaway from this data, linear data has limitations,
and none of that is helped by having a skewed data set. In the future we
would like to select a data set that has less of skewed target, or at
least try to sample this data at a better ratio again. It was fun to
look at though!
