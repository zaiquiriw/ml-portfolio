# Machine Learning Portfolio
## What Am I?
> A large portion of the class grade will be the work you upload to your portfolio. This will be a  combination of code, code narrative, reports, and presentations.

In my public repository, [ml-portfolio](https://github.com/zaiquiriw/ml-portfolio) you will find the code and notes I write while learning in Dr. Karen Mazidi's class *Introduction to Machine Learning*  at the University of Texas at Dallas. While this is currently just a markdown document with links to posted materials, I hope to expand this in the future, perhaps to hold resources accessed by a live site.

## TODO
- [ ] Finish setting up the main site at [zaiquiriw.github.io](zaiquiriw.github.io), goals can be found [here](https://github.com/zaiquiriw/zaiquiriw.github.io) 
- [ ] Port theme and set up Mkdocs
	- [ ] Set up Mkdocs build action
		- [ ] Must use absolute file paths until I change because I do not want to touch a jekyll config file for fixing relative file paths
	- [ ] Decide whether to build site in `gh-pages` branch or in `/(root)`
	- [ ] Host resources both as navigable html files, and link to pdfs.
	- [ ] I want to figure out how to easily format a download link in a markdown page, after the static generator has converted it to html. [Saving this!](https://downgit.github.io/#/home)
