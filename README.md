# Machine Learning Portfolio
## What Am I?
> A large portion of the class grade will be the work you upload to your portfolio. This will be a  combination of code, code narrative, reports, and presentations.

In my public repository, [ml-portfolio](https://github.com/zaiquiriw/ml-portfolio) you will find the code and notes I write while learning in Dr. Karen Mazidi's class *Introduction to Machine Learning*  at the University of Texas at Dallas. While this is currently just a markdown document with links to posted materials, I hope to expand this in the future, perhaps to hold resources accessed by a live site.

## TODO
- [ ] Finish setting up the main site at [zaiquiriw.github.io](https://zaiquiriw.github.io), goals can be found [here](https://github.com/zaiquiriw/zaiquiriw.github.io) 
- [ ] Port theme and set up Mkdocs
	- [ ] Set up Mkdocs build action
		- [ ] Must use absolute file paths until I change because I do not want to touch a jekyll config file for fixing relative file paths
	- [ ] Decide whether to build site in `gh-pages` branch or in `/(root)`
	- [ ] Host resources both as navigable html files, and link to pdfs.
	- [ ] I want to figure out how to easily format a download link in a markdown page, after the static generator has converted it to html. [Saving this!](https://downgit.github.io/#/home)

## Assignments
### 0: Getting Started
- [x] Create a GitHub portfolio for class work
- [x] Summarize the main branches of ML algorithms
- [x] Reflect on your personal interest in ML

An [Overview of ML](ml-overview.pdf) can be found in the repo! You can read it on [here](https://zaiquiriw.github.io/ml-portfolio/ml-overview/) as well

### 1: Data Exploration
- [X] Read a CSV file in C++
- [X] Create a suite of simple stats functions in C++
- [X] Find more complex values:
	- [X] Covariance
	- [X] Correlation 
- [X] Write documnetation on the value of this data

As we are learning R, we need a refresher on C++, so this was that. [The documentation](https://github.com/zaiquiriw/ml-portfolio/blob/main/assignment-1/documentation.pdf) explains the importance of what I went over, and the code practice can be found [here](https://github.com/zaiquiriw/ml-portfolio/blob/main/assignment-1/explore.cpp).


### 2: Linear Models
Well this was hard! Work on linear regression can be found [here](https://github.com/zaiquiriw/ml-portfolio/blob/main/linear models/Regression.pdf) and linear classification can be found [here](https://github.com/zaiquiriw/ml-portfolio/blob/main/linear models/Classification.pdf)!
